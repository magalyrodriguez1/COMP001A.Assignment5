<h2>Our history</h2>

<p>Halloween Night opened its first store in 1984, after having successful sales starting at home. Many
folks wanted spooky items year round, whether people wanted costumes for a play, decorations for a
festival, or even a party at home. After many folks encouraged Ms. Rodriguez to open a store front, she
did. And she did the right thing! After 10 years, she opened another store front in the next town over. And
from there, it spread. </p>

<h3>We offer a wide selection, including:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Decor</li>
    <li>Last minute decorations</li>
    <li>Not so stale candy</li>
