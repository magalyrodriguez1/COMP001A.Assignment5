<h2> Welcome to Halloween Night!</h2>

<h2>Our history</h2>

<p>Halloween Night opened its first store in 1984, after having successful sales starting at home. Many
folks wanted spooky items year round, whether people wanted costumes for a play, decorations for a
festival, or even a party at home. After many folks encouraged Ms. Rodriguez to open a store front, she
did. And she did the right thing! After 10 years, she opened another store front in the next town over. And
from there, it spread. </p>
